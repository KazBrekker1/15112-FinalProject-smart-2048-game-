# 15112-FinalProject-smart-2048-game

my project is based on the famous game 2048
if you do not know it, you can check it on this link ( https://play2048.co/ )
the used language for this project is ( python 2 )



* game description :
  (â€¬The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to 
   create a tile with the number 2048.However, one can continue to play the game
   after reaching the goal)
 
 
 
* The user experience and the features  :
 when the user runs my code he or she will see the following :
 1 - a widow that asks the player to choose the game mood either ( one player ) or ( VS The Computer ).
 
    if the player chooses the ( one player ) mood:
    
           . the player will see a window that contains 16 squares (4 x 4) with 2 squares that contains  ( 2 and 2 ) or ( 2 and 4 ).
           # you wil get better knowledge if you try the game form the link.

          . above the 16 square the player will see a bar that contains the number of moves.
          # the player can make the moves by using the arrows in the keyboard
          #it will start with 0 and each time the player make a move that bumer will increase by 1 

          . the player will keep playing until there is no more allowed moves the player can make .Then the player will see a window
            that asks the player to play again or exit the game.
            if the player chooses to play again he will start from the main window . 
            if the player chooses to exit the game will end.

    if the player chooses the ( Vs computer ) mood:
    
          . the player will see a widow that asks the player to choose the difficulty of the game ( normal , hard ).
          # you can know more about the AI that my game will include in the AI section down below.
          
          . the player will see two squares, each square will contains 16 squares (4 x4 ).
          # one of the squares will be the player's square and the another one will be the computer's square.
          
          . each square will conatins the features that the ( one player ) mood has.
          
          . the player should start to make the first move on, then the computer will make the next move. 
          
          . the game will continue like that until there is no more allowed moves the player can make .Then the player will see a window
            that asks the player to play again or exit the game.
            if the player chooses to play again he will start from the main window . 
            if the player chooses to exit the game will end.
            
            
            
 * the AI  
   in the ( Vs computer ) mood i will include AI to teach the computer how to play the game.
   the dificulty will depend on the algorithim that i will use.

   - the normal mood:
   the moves will be based on the ( alpha beta ) algorithm, which is basically make the computer make certien moves aheadand choose 
   the  choice that leads to the best results

   - the hard mood:
   just like the medium mood but with bigger number of moves the computer can see. 

* the libraries
# i might include more libraries or change all of them, but thses are the libraries that i will use until now 
- TKinter
- random

thanks for your time
